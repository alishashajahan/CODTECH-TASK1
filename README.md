OVERVIEW OF THE PROJETCT:This project is a simple To-Do List application created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Local Storage. The application allows users to input tasks, view the list of tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. It includes a clean and responsive design that allows users to easily interact with the tasks through the user interface.The project relies on JavaScript to handle dynamic behavior such as adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, which means they persist even if the page is refreshed, but are only accessible locally. This makes it a lightweight, single-page application that can be easily customized and expanded.
